# Quintype


This is a demo dashboard built using bootstrap-4. I chose bootstrap because the dasboard requires multiple card type interfaces and bootstrap provides easy to manipulate column framework which can be used to generate columns of different width and is resposive by design.

Things to fix:
- Email input field in nav-form
- Columns in col-md-4 are not of equal height. (Should be though since it is defaults in Bootstrap-4)
- Remove breaks from html file (not supported anymore)

Nice to have:
- Sliding underlines (currently these are static elements)
- Hover feature on each news article
